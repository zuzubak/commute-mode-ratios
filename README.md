## Setup

### Data
Before getting started, you'll need to download the zipped shapefiles for Canadian census tracts, and census subdivisions.
These can be found at the URL below. Select the "shapefile" option.

Unzip them, place the two unzipped folders in a subdirectory within the repo called "data", and you're good to go!
